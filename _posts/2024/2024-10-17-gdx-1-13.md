It has been some time since our last release, but version 1.13.0 of libGDX brings plenty of improvements and bug fixes. Check out the full list below to find out more.

Please note that at the moment, any desktop apps developed with version 1.13.0 seem to be incorrectly flagged by some antivirus programs. The likely cause is a [false positive of LWJGL 3's natives](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/issues/1005). Find out more [here](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-liftoff/issues/207).

## Breaking changes

The following changes require you to adapt your existing libGDX codebases:

- [ANDROID] The minimum API level is now `19` (Android 4.4).
- [ANDROID] Removed `Input#setCatchBackKey`, `#isCatchBackKey`, `#setCatchMenuKey`, and `#isCatchMenuKey` deprecated in 1.9.10. Use `#setCatchKey` and `#isCatchKey` instead.
- [ANDROID] The Android backend now depends on AndroidX. To update your old projects, add `android.useAndroidX=true` to your `gradle.properties` file and add `implementation "androidx.core:core:1.13.1"` as dependency to your Android module.
- [ANDROID & iOS] Exceptions occurring in `Runnable` tasks scheduled through `Gdx.app.postRunnable(...)` are no longer swallowed and will crash the app. Add a protection to your tasks if required.
- [GWT] Updated to [GWT 2.11.0](https://www.gwtproject.org/release-notes.html#Release_Notes_2_11_0) from 2.10.0. This improves the JRE emulation to support features from Java 11 like collections, streams, and more. To keep old projects working, add `com.google.jsinterop:jsinterop-annotations:2.0.2:sources` as dependency to your html subproject.
- [iOS] The minimum supported iOS version is now 12.0. Update your `Info.plist` file if necessary.
- [LWJGL3] The `gdx-lwjgl3-glfw-awt-macos` extension was retired. Just remove it from your dependencies and use the following snippet at the start of your `main()` method instead ([#7361](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7361)):
   ```java
   if (SharedLibraryLoader.isMac) {
       Configuration.GLFW_LIBRARY_NAME.set("glfw_async");
   }
   ```

## A few notable changes
In addition, there are a couple notable changes:

- [CORE] There have been a couple of minor performance improvements, in particular to `Sprite` and `SpriteBatch`.
- [CORE] Added Framebuffer multisample support ([#7185](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7185)). Take a look at [`GL31FrameBufferMultisampleTest`](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/tests/gdx-tests/src/com/badlogic/gdx/tests/gles31/GL31FrameBufferMultisampleTest.java) for a simple example of how to use it.
- [CORE] There is a new API to get user input via native text fields ([#7004](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7004)).
- [GWT] The audio device can be switched now ([#7243](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7243)). This has to be enabled via `GwtApplicationConfiguration#fetchAvailableOutputDevices` beforehand.
- [iOS] Updated to [MobiVM 2.3.21](https://github.com/MobiVM/robovm/wiki/Changelog#2321-february-2024) from 2.3.21.
- [iOS] The iOS backend now has an implementaion for `AudioDevice` ([#7371](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7371)). It can be configured through `IOSApplicationConfiguration` with `audioDeviceBufferSize` and `audioDeviceBufferCount`.
- [LWJGL3] Added the `Lwjgl3ApplicationConfiguration#pauseWhenMinimized` and `#pauseWhenLostFocus` flags to control when the application should call the `pause()` method on the `ApplicationListener` ([#7287](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7287)).
- [LWJGL3] Support for Linux RISC-V has been added ([#7275](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7275)).

To check out our progress towards the next release, take a look at the [corresponding milestone](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/milestone/7) on GitHub. As always, we appreciate feedback on the issues/PRs already part of the milestone and would like to invite you to bring forward anything still missing on our [Discord](/community/discord/) server!
